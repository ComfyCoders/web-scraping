# Scraping Twitter

### Brief

This project aims to develop our skills in web scraping, specifically scraping tweets.
Once we have this data we aim to analyse it based on the location data we can extract from the metadata and content of the tweet.
We plan to illustrate this analysis with some heat maps and graphs.

Our initial goals are to establish these web scraping skills and use this experience to narrow down the project objectives.
